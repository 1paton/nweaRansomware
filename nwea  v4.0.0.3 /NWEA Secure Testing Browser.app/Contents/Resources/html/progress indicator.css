Progress indicator by Hawkman. http://www.phantomgorilla.com/
based on  Apple's NSProgressIndicator in OS X. http://www.apple.com/
tested in Safari 2.0.3, FireFox (Mac) 1.0.7, IE:Mac.

/* This is all the CSS you'll need. Either reference this or incorporate it into your own CSS files. You'll also need the included "progress indicator.js" (again, referenced or incorporated into your files), and "progress indicator.html" (incorporated into your html file). I'd appreciate it if you leave my name at the top of the section, but there's no compulsion; this is free code! */

/* the only purpose of this is to ensure that the indicator is hidden to begin with; this should obviously be applied to the id of the image which you're using for the indicator. */
