-- this script expects to be loaded in code and you substitute the
-- placeholder below with the list of apps you want to quit.
-- Note that you will be passed app names and not process names.
-- You can't do anything like ask System Events about the process name since some apps have different process names (Firefox for instance)

set appsToQuit to apps_to_quit_placeholder

-- Quit each application
repeat with i from 1 to (count appsToQuit)
	delay 1.0
